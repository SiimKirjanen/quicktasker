		<h3 id="board"><strong>A) Board</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>"Board" is a central feature designed to help you organize and manage your tasks efficiently. Each board can have multiple stages, and each stage can contain numerous tasks. This hierarchical structure allows you to break down your projects into manageable parts and track progress effectively.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/board.png" alt="Board" />
		<p><strong>Stages:</strong> A board is divided into several stages, each representing a different phase of your project. For example, you might have stages like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." You can customize these stages to fit your workflow and project requirements.</p>
		
		<hr>

		<h3 id="task"><strong>B) Task</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>"Task" represents an individual unit of work that needs to be completed. Tasks are the building blocks of your projects, allowing you to break down complex projects into manageable pieces</p> 

		<img src="assets/images/task.png" alt="Task" />

		<p><strong>Editing Tasks:</strong> You can easily edit tasks to update their details, such as the title, description. This ensures that all relevant information is up-to-date and accessible to your team.</p>
		<p><strong>Assigning Users:</strong> Tasks can be assigned to QuickTasker users, allowing you to delegate responsibilities and track who is working on what. This helps in managing workloads and ensuring accountability.</p>
		<p><strong>Marking Tasks as Completed:</strong> Once a task is finished, you can mark it as completed. This helps in tracking progress and ensuring that nothing is overlooked.</p>
		<p><strong>Custom Fields:</strong> You can add custom fields to tasks to capture additional information specific to your workflow. This flexibility allows you to tailor the task details to your project's unique requirements.</p>
		<p><strong>Comments and Logs:</strong> Each task supports both private and public comments, enabling team members to communicate and collaborate effectively. Additionally, you can view logs related to the task to track changes and updates over time.</p>
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="user"><strong>C) User</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>"User" refers to a QuickTasker user who can be assigned to tasks and collaborate on projects. Admins have the ability to create and manage QuickTasker users, ensuring that the right people are assigned to the right tasks.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/user.png" alt="User" />

		<p><strong>Creating Users:</strong> Admins can create new QuickTasker users, providing them with the necessary credentials to access the system. This allows for effective delegation and collaboration within your team.</p>
		<p><strong>Editing Users:</strong> Similar to tasks, user details can be edited to keep information up-to-date.</p>
		<p><strong>Custom Fields:</strong> You can add custom fields to user profiles to capture additional information specific to your workflow. This flexibility allows you to tailor user profiles to meet your project's unique requirements.</p>
		<p><strong>Comments and Logs:</strong> Each user profile supports both private and public comments, enabling team members to communicate and collaborate effectively. Additionally, you can view logs related to the user to track changes and updates over time.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="user-page"><strong>D) User page</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Each QuickTasker user has their own mobile-like user page. On this page, users can manage their tasks and collaborate with their team effectively.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/user-page.png" alt="User page" style="padding-right: 42px" />
		<img src="assets/images/user-page2.png" alt="User page" />
		
		<p><strong>Assigned Tasks:</strong> Users can view all the tasks they are currently assigned to. This helps them keep track of their responsibilities and ensures that they stay on top of their work.</p>
		<p><strong>Assignable Tasks:</strong> In addition to their assigned tasks, users can also see tasks that are available for them to take on. This allows for flexibility and helps in distributing the workload evenly among team members.</p>
		<p><strong>Task Details:</strong> Users can click on task to view its details. This includes information such as the task title, description, task stage, and any associated custom fields. Having all the relevant information in one place makes it easier for users to understand and complete their tasks.</p>
		<p><strong>Comments:</strong> Users can add comments to tasks directly from their user page, enabling effective communication and collaboration within the team. Comments can be used to ask questions, provide updates, or share important information related to the task.</p>
